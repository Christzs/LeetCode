/**
 * Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the \
 * binary representation of n.
 * If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.
 *
 * Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's).
 * The distance between two 1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions.
 * For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.
 *
 * Â 
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 22
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
 * The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
 * The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
 * The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
 * Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 8
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
 * There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".
